# Red Pitaya Tutorials

Alex Hodges & Ruvi Lecamwasam

The *Red Pitaya* is a very powerful and versatile device. It combines both a CPU and FPGA, together with fast analog to digital converters, making it great for doing feedback and control. There is however a steep learning curve to programing the FPGA. We've written some material to ease this process, which we hope can take you from zero FPGA background to implementing basic feedback.

*It is possible, though unlikely, for improperly-written FPGA code to [permanently damage your device](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/q/293915/314171). We have tried our best to make sure everything is correct, but we don't take responsibility for any damage that may occur.*
