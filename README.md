# Red Pitaya Tutorials

Alex Hodges & Ruvi Lecamwasam

The *Red Pitaya* is a very powerful and versatile device. It combines both a CPU and FPGA, together with fast analog to digital converters, making it great for doing feedback and control. There is however a steep learning curve to programing the FPGA. We've written some material to ease this process, which we hope can take you from zero FPGA background to implementing basic feedback.

Check out our [Tutorials](/Tutorials/HOME_Tutorials/), or links for [Further reading](/References).

All designs have been tested on the [STEMLab-14](https://redpitaya.com/stemlab-125-14). The code should still work on other models, in some cases with minor modifications that we'll try our best to mention. Note that Vivado, the tool we use to program the FPGA, only supports Windows and Linux. There are some articles online about running Vivado on a Mac using a virtual machine, but we haven't tested this.

*It is possible, though highly unlikely, for improperly-written FPGA code to [permanently damage your device](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/q/293915/314171). We have tried our best to make sure everything is correct, but we don't take responsibility for any damage that may occur.*
