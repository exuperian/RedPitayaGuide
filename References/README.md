Here are some references if you want to learn more about FPGA programming.

## Red Pitaya

### Tutorials

* Anton Potoƒçnik has a great set of [FPGA tutorials for the Red Pitaya](http://antonpotocnik.com/?cat=29). 
* Pavel Denim has done many [projects with comprehensive write-ups](http://pavel-demin.github.io/red-pitaya-notes/).
* Koheron has several projects with writeups [on their GitHub](https://github.com/Koheron/koheron-sdk/tree/master/examples/red-pitaya).

### Datasheets

* Datasheets for the [Analog to Digital Converter (ADC)](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/21454314fa.pdf), and [Digital to Analog Converter (DAC)](https://www.renesas.com/us/en/document/dst/dac1401d125-datasheet).

## FPGA Programming

### General

* Stacey's [FPGAs for Beginners YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@FPGAsforBeginners) has excellent videos covering all aspects of FPGA design.
* [Glitches and Hazards in Digital Circuits, by John Knight](https://www.doe.carleton.ca/~shams/ELEC3500/hazards.pdf)

### Verilog

* An excellent introduction to the basics is [Introduction to Logic Circuits & Logic Design with Verilog](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Logic-Circuits-Design-Verilog-dp-3030136043/dp/3030136043/ref=dp_ob_title_bk), by Brock LaMeres. This covers the required knowledge of binary, basic circuit elements, and how these can be used to do computation.

* The website [HDLBits](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Main_Page) has lots of example problems to work through. It also has an online simulator, so you can easily check if your answers are correct.

* [Verilog Golden Reference Guide](http://class.ece.iastate.edu/cpre488/resources/verilog_reference_guide.pdf)

### Vivado

* [An overview of what constraints are](https://support.xilinx.com/s/article/564948?language=en_US).
