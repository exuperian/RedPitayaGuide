# Further reading

Here are some references if you want to learn more about FPGA programming.

## Verilog

* An excellent introduction to the basics is [Introduction to Logic Circuits & Logic Design with Verilog](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Logic-Circuits-Design-Verilog-dp-3030136043/dp/3030136043/ref=dp_ob_title_bk), by Brock LaMeres. This covers the required knowledge of binary, basic circuit elements, and how these can be used to do computation.

* The website [HDLBits](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Main_Page) has lots of example problems to work through. It also has an online simulator, so you can easily check if your answers are correct.

## Red Pitaya

* Anton Potoƒçnik has a great set of [FPGA tutorials for the Red Pitaya](http://antonpotocnik.com/?cat=29). 
* Pavel Denim has done many [projects with comprehensive write-ups](http://pavel-demin.github.io/red-pitaya-notes/).
