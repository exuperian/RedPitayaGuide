# Tutorials

Here are the tutorials we have written so far on FPGA programming with the Red Pitaya. If you are just getting started, we recommend:

1. [Setting up a Red Pitaya](/Tutorials/SETUP_Connecting)
2. [Installing Vivado](/Tutorials/SETUP_InstallingVivado)
3. [Base Vivado design](/Tutorials/SETUP_BaseCode)
4. [LED binary counter](/Tutorials/PROJ_LEDCounter)
5. [Compiling and running code on the Pitaya](/Tutorials/SETUP_Compiling)

## The basics

### Red Pitaya

* [Setting up a Red Pitaya](/Tutorials/SETUP_Connecting)

### Vivado

- [Installing Vivado](/Tutorials/SETUP_InstallingVivado)
- [Base Vivado design](/Tutorials/SETUP_BaseCode)
- [Compiling and running code on the Pitaya](/Tutorials/SETUP_Compiling)
- [Simulating binary counters in Vivado](/Tutorials/PROJ_LEDSimulating)

## Projects

### Learn the basics with LEDs

Learn key features of the Red Pitaya through example projects with its inbuilt LEDs. No other equipment is required.

* [LED binary counter](/Tutorials/PROJ_LEDCounter)
* [LED binary counter with Verilog](/Tutorials/PROJ_LEDCounterVerilog)
* [Simulating binary counters in Vivado](/Tutorials/PROJ_LEDSimulating)
* [Controlling the LEDs with AXI GPIO](/Tutorials/PROJ_LEDAXI)

### Input and output

Learn how to use the fast analog input and output ports. You'll need an oscilloscope and signal generator to test these out.

* [Generating a sine wave](/Tutorials/PROJ_IOSignalGeneration)
* [Feeding an input signal through to the output](/Tutorials/PROJ_IOFeedthrough)

### Digital filtering

The Red Pitaya can be used as a programmable digital filter for frequencies at megahertz and below. You'll need to oscilloscope and signal generator to test these out, and to have gone through the *Input and output* section.

* [Simple FIR filter](/Tutorials/FILTER_SimpleFIR)
* Reducing the sample rate - decimation
* Low-frequency filtering
