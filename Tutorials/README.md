# Tutorials

Here are the tutorials we've made


## Getting started
To begin with, see [Base setup](/Tutorials/SETUP_BaseCode) for how to build the base Vivado design for the Red Pitaya. A good first project is the [LED binary counter](/Tutorials/PROJ_LEDCounter), and then see our [tutorial on compiling](/Tutorials/SETUP_Compiling) for how to deploy this to the Pitya.
