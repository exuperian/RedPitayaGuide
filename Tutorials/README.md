# Tutorials

Here are the tutorials we have written so far on FPGA programming with the Red Pitaya. If you are just getting started, we recommend:

1. [Setting up a Red Pitaya](/Tutorials/SETUP_Connecting)
2. [Base Vivado design](/Tutorials/SETUP_BaseCode)
3. [LED binary counter](/Tutorials/PROJ_LEDCounter)
4. [Compiling and running code on the Pitaya](/Tutorials/SETUP_Compiling)

## Full list of tutorials

### Red Pitaya basics

* [Setting up a Red Pitaya](/Tutorials/SETUP_Connecting)

### Vivado

- [Base Vivado design](/Tutorials/SETUP_BaseCode)
- [Compiling and running code on the Pitaya](/Tutorials/SETUP_Compiling)
- [Simulating binary counters in Vivado](/Tutorials/PROJ_LEDSimulating)

### Learn the basics with LEDs

This series introduces the key features of the Red Pitaya through example projects with the board's inbuilt LEDs. No other equipment is required.

* [LED binary counter](/Tutorials/PROJ_LEDCounter)
* [LED binary counter with Verilog](/Tutorials/PROJ_LEDCounterVerilog)
* [Controlling the LEDs with AXI GPIO](/Tutorials/PROJ_LEDAXI)
