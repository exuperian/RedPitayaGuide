# Tutorials

Here are the tutorials we have written so far on FPGA programming with the Red Pitaya. If you are just getting started, we recommend:

1. [Setting up a Red Pitaya](/Tutorials/SETUP_Connecting)
2. [Base Vivado design](/Tutorials/SETUP_BaseCode)
3. [LED binary counter](/Tutorials/PROJ_LEDCounter)
4. [Compiling and running code on the Pitaya](/Tutorials/SETUP_Compiling)
